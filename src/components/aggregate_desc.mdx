Type of asset field to *reference* assets from another collection `A`.

For example, field `drives` references assets from the `car` asset collection:
```archetype
asset car {
  vin     : string;
  nbdoors : nat = 0
}

asset driver {
  id     : address;
  drives : aggregate<car>
}
```

Notes:
* two drivers may reference the same car
* adding in `drives` fails if car's vin is not present in `car` collection.
