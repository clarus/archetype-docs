Adds a new asset or updates asset with key `k` in collection `A`:
* it adds a new asset if asset `k` is not in `A`
* it updates asset `k` is in `A`

For example, consider the `ledger` asset:
```archetype
asset ledger identified by holder to big_map {
  holder     : address;
  tokens     : nat = 0;
}
```

Consider the following *addupdate* instruction:
```archetype
ledger.addupdate(%to, { tokens += value });
```
* if `%to` holder is not in the `ledger` collection, this adds asset `{ %to; valueÂ }` to it
* if `%to` is in `ledger` collection, this increments the `tokens` field by `value`

:::info
Note that it is possible to use the `+=` assignement instruction on field `tokens` because `tokens` has a *default value* specified (`0`) in asset declaration.
