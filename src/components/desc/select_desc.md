Selects assets from collection `A` that verifies predicate `p`.

A predicate is an expression typed `bool`; its use the `the` keyword to refer to the evaluated asset. For example, consider the following `car` asset declaration:
```archetype
asset car {
  vin     : string;
  nbdoors : nat = 0;
}
```

The following expression returns cars with number of doors greater than 3:
```archetype
var v : view<car> = car.select(the.nbdoors > 3);
```
