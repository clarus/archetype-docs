# Operation

## `transfer`

The `transfer` instruction generates an [operation](/docs/reference/types#operation).

This operation is either a simple transfer operation of a part of the contract [`balance`](/docs/reference/expressions/constants#balance) to an account or a contract, or a call to another contract's entrypoint.

### Transfer balance

The following transfers an amount `a` of tez to address `c`:
```archetype
transfer a to c
```

It fails if amount `a` is greater than the contract [`balance`](/docs/reference/expressions/constants#balance).

### Call another contract

Consider a contract with address `c` that declares an [entrypoint](/docs/reference/declarations/entrypoint) `e` with argument of type `T` as follows:
```archetype
entry e(x : T) { /* ... */ }
```

The following calls entrypoint `e` with argument value `x` of type `T`:
```archetype
transfer a to c call e<T>(x)
```

It fails if amount `a` is greater than the contract balance or if contract `c` does not have entrypoint `e` with corresponding signature.

For example, consider the following contract:
```archetype
archetype called_contract

variable r : nat = 0

entry exec(x : nat, y : nat) {
    r := r * x + y
}
```

Then the following `transfer` instruction calls the `exec` entrypoint:
```archetype
transfer 0tz to c call exec<nat * nat>((4,5))
```

Note that the multiple arguments of `exec` is turned into a tuple of corresponding values.

### Call current contract

It is possible to call another entrypoint `e` of the current contract with the follwing instruction:
```archetype
transfer a to entry self.e(x)
```

For example, the following would call the `exec` entrypoint from another entrypoint of the same contract:
```archetype
transfer 0tz to entry self.exec(4,5)
```

### Low level instruction

The `transfer` instruction is pre-compiled to the low level instruction [`mkoperation`](/docs/reference/expressions/builtins#mkoperation(a%20:%20tez,%20c%20:%20contract<T>,%20arg%20:%20T)).

The following instruction:
```archetype
transfer a to c call e<T>(x)
```

is equivalent to:
```archetype
const e = require_entrypoint<T>("%e", c, "ENTRY_NOT_FOUND");
const o = mkoperation(a, e, x);
operations.prepend(o)
```

`operations` is the builtin list of operations returned by the entrypoint.

:::caution
Operations generated by the `transfer` instruction will be executed in the order the `transfer` instructions appear in the code.

Indeed operations in the builtin `operations` list are naturally ordered in the reverse order because of the [`prepend`](/docs/reference/instructions/containers#lprepende) instruction, but the list is [reversed](/docs/reference/expressions/builtins#reverse(l%20:%20list<T>)) when several operations are generated by the entrypoint.
